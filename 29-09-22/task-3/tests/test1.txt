For technical reasons, you need to know the seed of your world to use Seed Map, unless, of course, 
you want to find a seed for a new world. If you're playing SSP, the app is able to fetch the seed from your savegame. 
Alternatively, you can use the /seed command ingame. In SMP, you can use the same command if you have sufficient rights. 
Otherwise, however, you're dependent on the server owner, who started the world and has access to the savegame and config files.
