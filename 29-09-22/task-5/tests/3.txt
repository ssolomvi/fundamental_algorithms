If your in-game world doesn't match the map here at all, it's most likely due to one of the following:
you entered the wrong seed or coordinates;
you selected the wrong edition or version (the one used to generate the region you look at);
you used mods or resource packs that affect world generation;
(for slime chunks) you didn't wait long enough, since they have a very low spawn rate even in slime chunks;
